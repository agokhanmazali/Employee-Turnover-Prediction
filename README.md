# Employee Turnover Reduction Models with Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
Employee turnover is a serious problem accross all the firms. It is expensive and time consuming to find candidate, train them and include them in company workflow.

In this project we will explore IBM HR dataset to find culprits of employee turnover and then apply machine learning algorithms from scratch to create models for
predict employee turnover. Project is uploaded as python notebook.
